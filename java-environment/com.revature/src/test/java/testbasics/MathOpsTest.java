	 * 
	 * 1 - Test File will be loaded into memory
	 * 		-There is some other work that goes in here, regarding
	 * 			the creation of objects...
	 * 
	 * Afterwards... We will execute methods in order, based
	 * on the annotations provided:
	 * 
	 * 2 - @BeforeClass - This method will be executed
	 * 		-@BeforeClass is used for general test setup
	 * 		-@Before class methods should be static
	 * 
	 * 3 - Create an instance of the Test class 
	 * 
	 * 4 - Invoke the @Before annotated method(s)
	 * 		-@Before is used to perform setup prior to each
	 * 			test that is executed
	 * 
	 * 5 - Invoke the @Test annotated method(s)
	 * 		-These methods are invoked in order that they
	 * 			appear in the test file
	 * 
	 * 6 - Invoke the @After annotated method(s) after
	 * 		each test which is ran
	 * 		-@After is used to perform some sort of 'tear down'
	 * 		 	or cleanup process after each method
	 * 
	 * 7 - After all tests complete the @AfterClass annotated
	 * 		method is executed
