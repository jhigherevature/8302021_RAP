# Project Presentation Guideline

The following is a general guideline for presenting your projects. You are not required to follow this guide exactly, but the following flow for your presentation can help guide how to talk about the aspects of your project.

* Make sure to implement a Code Freeze for 24 hours prior to presentation day and use that time to practice your actual presentation!

* 5-10 min project presentation
  * Introduce Yourself & Project
  * Start your application
  * Show that you can create a new user
  * Show that you can log in (using new user)
  * Show some functionality of that user
    * add new records
    * search existing records
    * update existing records
    * remove records (not a requirement for every user level)
  * Showcase changes in DB
  * Logout
  * Login as another existing user (different level of privileges)

* 5-10 min Q&A afterward presentation

## Priority:
prioritize the following when presenting information for your project
1. Working application
1. Functional Unit Tests
1. Logging
1. Showcasing application code (java and/or rdbms)
